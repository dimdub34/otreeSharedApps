## **Applications**

### **BART : Balloon Analogue Risk Task**

The BART, introduced by Lejuez et al. (2002), is a widely used behavioral measure of risk-taking.
Participants are asked to inflate a virtual balloon, earning rewards with each pump, but facing the risk of the
balloon bursting at an unknown threshold. The task captures individual differences in risk preferences by assessing
the trade-off between potential gains and losses.

üîç **Key Findings:**

- The BART correlates with real-world risk behaviors such as substance use and gambling.
- It distinguishes between adaptive and maladaptive risk-taking tendencies.
- The task provides a dynamic measure of risk propensity, improving upon traditional self-report questionnaires.

### **BRET: Bomb Risk Elicitation Task**

The BRET, introduced by Crosetto & Filippin (2013), is a widely used tool to measure individual risk preferences in an
incentive-compatible manner.
Participants select a number of boxes to collect, each containing monetary rewards, while facing the risk that one of
the boxes contains a hidden bomb that would wipe out their earnings.

üîç **Key Findings:**

- The BRET provides a continuous measure of risk preferences.
- It avoids distortions found in traditional lottery-based risk elicitation methods.
- Risk-taking behavior varies across contexts, incentives, and demographics.

### **Eckel & Grossman**

This repository provides an oTree implementation of the Eckel & Grossman Risk Elicitation Task, a widely used method 
for measuring risk preferences in experimental economics. Originally based on Binswanger (1980), this approach was 
adapted and refined by Eckel & Grossman (2002, 2008) to offer a simpler, incentive-compatible mechanism for 
eliciting individual risk attitudes.

Participants choose between a set of lotteries with varying risk levels, allowing researchers to classify them along 
the risk-aversion spectrum. The task is commonly used in behavioral and experimental economics due to its clarity and 
ease of implementation.

üîç Key Features:

- The lottery values used in this implementation are based on Dave et al. (2010), scaled down by a factor of 10 to 
represent Euros for control tasks.
- Provides a simple yet robust measure of risk preferences.
- Can be easily customized to adjust lottery payoffs, probabilities, and framing.

### **NLE: Number Line Estimation**

This repository provides an oTree implementation of the Number Line Estimation (NLE) Task, a widely used cognitive 
test in numerical cognition research. The task requires participants to estimate the position of a given number on a 
visual number line, assessing their numerical representation and estimation accuracy.

Siegler, R. S., & Opfer, J. E. (2003). The development of numerical estimation: Evidence for multiple representations of numerical quantity. Psychological Science, 14(3), 237‚Äì243.

üîç **Key Findings**:

- The task reveals individual differences in numerical estimation strategies (linear vs. logarithmic representation).
- Performance on the NLE task is correlated with mathematical achievement and cognitive development.
- Variations of the task can assess intuitive number sense and symbolic number processing.

### **SVO: Social Value Orientation**

This repository provides an oTree implementation of the Social Value Orientation (SVO) Task, a widely used tool in 
behavioral and experimental economics to measure individual social preferences. The task evaluates how participants 
allocate resources between themselves and others, identifying their prosocial, individualistic, or competitive 
orientation.

Murphy, R. O., Ackermann, K. A., & Handgraaf, M. J. J. (2011). Measuring Social Value Orientation. 
Judgment and Decision Making, 6(8), 771‚Äì781.

üîç **Key Findings**:

- Identifies individual differences in social preferences, distinguishing prosocials, individualists, and competitors.
- Strongly correlated with cooperative behavior in economic and social dilemmas.
- Used to predict trust, reciprocity, and fairness in decision-making contexts.

## Slider Task

This repository provides an oTree implementation of the Slider Task, originally developed by Gill & Prowse (2012) 
as a measure of real effort in experimental economics. Participants are required to adjust sliders to specified target 
positions within a limited time, allowing researchers to assess effort provision, performance incentives, 
and cognitive/motor skills.

üìÑ **Reference**:

Gill, D., & Prowse, V. (2012). A Structural Analysis of Disappointment Aversion in a Real Effort Competition. American Economic Review, 102(1), 469-503.

üîç **Key Findings**:

- Used to measure effort exertion in economic experiments.
- Provides a real-effort task that is incentive-compatible and easy to implement.
- Can be used in tournaments, individual effort settings, and team-based designs.
